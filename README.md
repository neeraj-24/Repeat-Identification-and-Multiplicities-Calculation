# Repeat-Identification-and-Multiplicities-Finder
This pipeline provides a Python-based workflow for parsing YASS output, identifying repeat units, and finding their multiplicities. It would benefit the bioinformatics fraternity; this tool can help analyze repeat units in any length of the genome sequences, with applications in immunology, genomics, and related fields.
