# Repeat-Identification-and-Multiplicities-Calculation
This project provides a Python-based workflow for parsing YASS output, identifying repeat units, and calculating their multiplicities. Designed for bioinformatics applications, this tool can help analyze repeat units in any lenth of the genome sequences, with applications in immunology, genomics, and related fields.
